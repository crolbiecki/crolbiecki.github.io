		<h5>Summary</h5>
		<p>Intercept is a software for creating business plans. Because the software is very complex and could easily be overwhelming, the client wanted a style that is approachable and inviting. I did the user interface for the screens.

		<h5>Background</h5>
		<p>Since the client wanted to have a friendly and approachable style for the software, I decided to use a colorful palette. I also decided to not use a full white background on the pages since the software is meant to be used for an extended period of time and could strain the users' eyes if the background was white. I used a sans serif font because its both approachable and easier to read on a screen. Because the software is so robust, I mocked up a couple of the key screens the client would need. Below is an example of what the dashboard looked like before the UX and UI changes.

		<h5>Dashboard</h5>
		<p>The dashboard is how the program is organized. I created the icons to be simple and easily readable. Because the program is complex and has a lot of sub navigation levels, I wanted to keep the different sections its own color. That way the color could add another level of help for the user remember where certain information is located.</p>
