		<h5>Summary</h5>
		<p>Huddle is a conceptual online learning platform that facilitates the desire for social interaction when learning outside of a traditional classroom. I was the UX designer in a team that consisted of one other UX designer and two UI designers.

		<h5>Background</h5>
		<p>Online learning is a growing industry due to the increase of skills required for jobs from changing technology and because of the increase in internet accessibility. Huddle was an exploratory project that was created in order to solve needs and frustrations people encountered when trying to learn online and improve the overall experience of online learning.

		<h5>Research</h5>
		<p>The first task our team did was gather data about the online learning industry. We did a competitive analysis and SWOT diagrams on other online learning platforms in order to understand what the market was and what opportunities we had for introducing a new platform. We discovered that there were few platforms that had a natively supported community and that most platforms had a fee to use.</p>

		<p>After researching the domain of the project, we decided to interview online learning users about their frustrations and needs they experienced when learning online. We also utilized surveys to gather large amounts of quantitative data that we could use in addition to the qualitative information collected from the user interviews.

		<h5>Insights</h5>
 		<p>After we had collected all of this data from research, we had to then make sense of it and transform the information into meaningful opportunities. Based off of the key data from our interviews and surveys, we embodied the findings into two user personas. These personas would be used to represent our demographic and remind us of the needs of our users.

		<strong>User Journey</strong>
		<p>We also created a journey map for our users in order to understand their thoughts and feelings when going through an online learning experience. </p>

		<h5>Design Principles</h5>
		<p>One of our key findings was that when users had a question or got stuck they became unmotivated because they were used to having a peer or teacher in the vicinity to answer the question immediately when in a traditional classroom setting. We also discovered that forums were very popular and were enjoyed by most of the users we interviewed because they were not only one way to find answers to problems they had, but also because they felt comfort in knowing that other users were in the same situaton as them. We incorporated these findings into design principles that we would follow when creating the wireframes.</p>

		<h5>Wireframes</h5>
		<p>From there we developed an initial hand sketched wireframes that we used to user test our concept. We wanted to implement a way to feel a sense of community. One of the challenges we faced was trying to create a system where users would be in a group and learning the same material, but without sacrificing the time flexibility that online learning excels at.</p>
		<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="../img/Huddle_landingPage.png" alt="" />	
		
		<p>Our solution was to place users in small groups that would start at a designated week, but the users could complete the material at the course at their own pace. I also designed the huddle button interaction that allowed users to have a central focus for all the group interactions and remind them that they were not alone when going through the course. In addition, this feature could become an enjoyable microinteraction and a brand identity. From there I created wireframes in Axure that we used to continue to test and reiterate on.

		<h5>Hi-Fidelity Prototype</h5>
		<p>After several rounds of user testing and iterations, we developed our hi-fidelity prototype.  </p>
