		<h5>Summary</h5>
		<p>Local Guide was an exploratory project for Designation that consisted of creating a mobile application whose primary user would be people who are traveling. I did the UX and UI for this project.

		<h5>Background</h5>
		<p>The Local Guide App is a mobile application to meet user needs while traveling. Through user interviews I would determine what users' goals and needs are while traveling and translate that into a mobile app.

		<h5>Research</h5>
		<p>By reading through twenty user interviews, I was able to learn more about the needs and frustrations people had when they were traveling. I found that there was a need and desire for people to have local knowledge of their location and to be able to access location information quickly. </p>

		<h5>Insights</h5>
 		<p>After learning about the different people who travel, I used an affinity diagram to make connections of what needs and frustrations of the users were. This led to creating two user personas that the application would be designed for. One persona was the famly man who travels for vacation with his family. The other persona was the business traveler, who travels because of work.

		<strong>Persona 1 - The Family Man</strong>
		<ul>Key Points:
			<li>Traveling is for leisure and spending family time.</li>
			<li>He is often on a budget.</li>
			<li>Wants to make sure his kids are having a fun time and that areas are safe</li></ul>	
		</div>

<div class="col-md-5 pull-right">	
			<strong>Persona 2 - The Business Traveler</strong>
		<ul>Key Points:
			<li>Travels for business meetings.</li>
			<li>He is often on time restrictions due to meetings.</li>
			<li>Wants to experience local places rather than tourist attractions.</li></ul>

		<strong>User Journey</strong>
		<p>I also created a journey map for our users in order to understand their thoughts and feelings when traveling. </p>

		<h5>Design Principles</h5>
		<p>One of our key findings was that when users had a question or got stuck they became unmotivated because they were used to having a peer or teacher in the vicinity to answer the question immediately when in a traditional classroom setting. I also discovered that forums were very popular and were enjoyed by most of the users we interviewed because they were not only one way to find answers to problems they had, but also because they felt comfort in knowing that other users were in the same situaton as them. I incorporated these findings into design principles that we would follow when creating the wireframes.</p>

		<h5>Wireframes</h5>
		<p>From there I developed an initial hand sketched wireframes that we used to user test our concept. I wanted to implement a way to feel a sense of community. One of the challenges we faced was trying to create a system where users would be in a group and learning the same material, but without sacrificing the time flexibility that online learning excels at.</p>

		<p>Our solution was to place users in small groups that would start at a designated week, but the users could complete the material at the course at their own pace. I also designed the huddle button interaction that allowed users to have a central focus for all the group interactions and remind them that they were not alone when going through the course. In addition, this feature could become an enjoyable microinteraction and a brand identity. From there I created wireframes in Axure that we used to continue to test and reiterate on.

		<h5>Hi-Fidelity Prototype</h5>
		<p>After several rounds of user testing and iterations, I developed our hi-fidelity prototype.  </p>
