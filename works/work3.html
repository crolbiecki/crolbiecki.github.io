		<h5>Summary</h5>
		<p>Local Guide was an exploratory project for Designation that consisted of creating a mobile application whose primary user would be people who are traveling. I did the UX and UI for this project.

		<h5>Background</h5>
		<p>The Local Guide App is a mobile application to meet user needs while traveling. Through user interviews I would determine what users' goals and needs are while traveling and translate that into a mobile app.

		<h5>Research</h5>
		<p>By reading through twenty user interviews, I was able to learn more about the needs and frustrations people had when they were traveling. I found that there was a need and desire for people to have local knowledge of their location and to be able to access location information quickly. </p>

		<h5>Insights</h5>
 		<p>After learning about the different people who travel, I used an affinity diagram to make connections of what needs and frustrations of the users were. This led to creating two user personas that the application would be designed for. One persona was the famly man who travels for vacation with his family. The other persona was the business traveler, who travels because of work.

		<strong>Persona 1 - The Family Man</strong>
		<ul>Key Points:
			<li>Traveling is for leisure and spending family time.</li>
			<li>He is often on a budget.</li>
			<li>Wants to make sure his kids are having a fun time and that areas are safe</li></ul>

			<strong>Persona 2 - The Business Traveler</strong>
		<ul>Key Points:
			<li>Travels for business meetings.</li>
			<li>He is often on time restrictions due to meetings.</li>
			<li>Wants to experience local places rather than tourist attractions.</li></ul>

		<strong>User Journey</strong>
		<p>I also created a journey map for our users in order to understand their thoughts and feelings when traveling. </p>

		<h5>Wireframes</h5>
		<p>From there I developed initial hand sketched wireframes that we used to user test our concept. My main goal was to implement a way to feel a sense of community. One of the challenges we faced was trying to create a system where users would be in a group and learning the same material, but without sacrificing the time flexibility that online learning excels at. Our solution was to place users in small groups that would start at a selected date, but the users could complete the material at the course at their own pace within the timeframe. I also designed the huddle button interaction that allowed users to have a central focus for all the group interactions and remind them that they were not alone when going through the course. In addition, this feature could become an enjoyable microinteraction and a brand identity.</p>

		<h5>Axure Prototype</h5>
		<p>One of the major changes we decided to make from the original wireframes after testing was to remove the option of a calendar to pick a start date. Even though it seemed like a good idea because it would allow for more flexible class times, the option to choose any date was overwhelming to the user. Instead we decided to have the user choose from already picked start dates. This allowed for an easier proccess because it minimized the number of choises the user had to make. With the changes decided from the usability testing feedback, I created a new wireframe in Axure that we used to continue to test and reiterate on.</p>
